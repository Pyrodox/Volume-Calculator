Originally got the idea from this website, but I used volumes of 3D shapes instead of areas of polygons.
I did not mod this project; it was created by me.
THis project was created to solidify my understanding of classes and objects.

Some features:
1. The volume calculator asks for which shape you'd like to calculate.
2. can catch errors and asks the user again if they typed in a wrong float or string.
3. user can restart program
4. while loops
5. use of classes, a dictionary, a tuple
